## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `how it's works`

1. Before rendering the map I am calling the backend API that resturns an array of 50 routes.
2. Render the map with the returned routes.
3. Select every 10 millisecond a random index and replase the index value with a random coordinates.

### `Remarks`

I used "create-react-app" because it's very easy and fast to install. <br />
However, If I had more time I would created project from scratch instead using a boilerplate.
